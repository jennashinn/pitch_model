## Using Machine Learning to Classify Pitch Type

This is a Python implementation of a **Predictive Modeling and Machine Learning** project using **DecisionTree** to classify (predict) pitch types from major league pitchers. 

#### Data Source
The data is from BaseballSavant and contains every pitch from the MLB 2021 regular season. You can download the dataset from [BaseballSavant](https://baseballsavant.mlb.com/statcast_search). The dates for this data are 4/1/21 - 10/3/21

#### Goals
- Manipulating data and removing outliers
- Deciding which variables to use for **predictive modeling**
- Training and testing the data with **machine learning**
- Displaying results with **data visualization** techniques using Matlibplot and Seaborn

Note: Since the data was originally for a different project, it has already been cleaned.
